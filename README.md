# ionic v2 Sample

Following the official guide: http://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/setup/installation/

## CI notes:

Either commit the `platforms/` directory into your repository (remove it from `.gitignore`),
or if you don't want to then you'll have to run `cordova platform add android`
on any new Mac/PC or in CI, as the `platforms/` directory is in the
default `.gitignore` which is generated by `ionic start ProjectName --v2`.


## Run locally

```
bitrise run docker-compose-console
cd cutePuppyPics && ionic serve
```

## ToDo:

* Build Cache
